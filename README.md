# RespGOV

Responsive Governance is a web-based application to improve the Functionalities of various Government departments. The process of centralizing different departments is a difficult task. To minimize the confusion and maximize the easiness we centralize the complaint sections of different departments. It makes it easier to give complaints to the various departments like water, gas, electricity, based on the consumer’s problem. If a consumer wants to give a complaint, they first register into the site using their Aadhar card number.
It consists of users such as consumers, department heads and employees. When we send a complaint to a particular department, the same can viewed by that particular department head. He can view the complaint and allot a worker to maintain the complaint. Worker can view the complaints and update his status like time, date of maintaining etc. When he updates the status, the user can view the. And user can also get a confirmation mail during the time of complaint booking.
Workers can also update the working details like is the work completed or pending or work in progress like that user can also view the updated details through the site.

Existing System
Departments deal with different day-to-day activities that take place generally in any system. In the existing manual system huge expenditure and a lot of time is spent in communicating the information across different branches.  So, there is a need for an integrated automated system, which has some centralized control over the entire process.
The following drawbacks of the existing system emphasize the need for computerization of the Grievance Handling System: 
Difficulty in tracking and retrieving data from the abundant papers is quite difficult.
Need for Computerization.
Duplication of work avoided.
Retrieval and access of data is easy.
